This is my college project,

 a groundbreaking website that serves as an e-commerce platform connecting industries with surplus waste materials to individuals seeking those resources but lacking proper connections.

âœ¨ The aim is to minimize waste by facilitating a symbiotic relationship between industries with excess materials and individuals looking for those resources, fostering sustainability and resource efficiency.
